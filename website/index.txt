<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install xrefresh-server</pre>

h2. Run monitoring server

After installation xrefresh-server executable should get onto your system path. To start server simply run:
<pre syntax="ruby">xrefresh-server</pre>

h2. The config file

This is default config file:
<pre syntax="ruby">
# here specify list of paths to monitor
paths:
  - /Users/<your-user-name> # by default watch user's home directory
# - /you/may/add/here/some/other/path
# - /you/may/add/here/some/another/path

# you can various filters (ruby regexp pattern)
# every file is split to dir and file part (for example /Users/mick/proj/coolapp and some_file.rb)
#   both include filters must be satisfied
#   both exclude filters must not be satisfied
# empty value means "apply no filtering"
dir_include:
dir_exclude: ^/Users/<your-user-name>/Library|/\.(svn|framework|app|pbproj|pbxproj|xcode(proj)?|bundle)/
file_include:
file_exclude: ^(CVS|SCCS|vssver.?.scc|\.(cvsignore|svn|DS_Store)|_svn|Thumbs\.db)$|~$|^(\.(?!htaccess)[^/]*|\.(tmproj|o|pyc)|svn-commit(\.[2-9])?\.tmp)$ # merged TextMate and Netbeans patterns

# xpert settings
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 41258 # known port for clients to connect 
max_connections: 4 # max client connections
debug: false # run in debug mode?
audit: false # audit server activity
defer_time: 0.5 # aggregation time for events
sleep_time: 0.1 # don't hung cpu in main loop
</pre>

As you can see, by default monitor watches your home directory excluding all under ~/Library.
You are encouraged to modify paths section to map to your working project directories.

By default config file is searched first in current directory and then in your home directory.
You may also specify path to config file via --config parameter.

When you first run xrefresh-server and there is no config file found, xrefresh-server will ask to create one for you in your home directory.
